Reading alignment file stupidali.fa ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains protein sequences
Alignment has 4 sequences with 21 columns, 21 distinct patterns
0 parsimony-informative, 21 singleton sites, 0 constant sites
       Gap/Ambiguity  Composition  p-value
   1  poo      0.00%    failed      1.82%
   2  wee      0.00%    passed     61.56%
   3  willy    0.00%    passed     33.92%
   4  boobs    0.00%    passed     43.40%
****  TOTAL    0.00%  1 sequences failed composition chi2 test (p-value<5%; df=10)
NOTE: State(s) R, N, D, Q, H, K, M, F, S not present in alignment and thus removed from Markov process to prevent numerical problems
NOTE: 9 states (see above) are not present and thus removed from Markov process to prevent numerical problems
Reading input tree file nonrev.treefile ... rooted tree
WARNING: NONREV model will estimate 379 substitution rates that might be overfitting!
WARNING: Please only use NONREV with very large data and always test for model fit!

NOTE: 0 MB RAM (0 GB) is required!
